### Hey there, I'm ***Wyatt*** 👋

I grew up in the [***Eastern Sierras***  in California](https://goo.gl/maps/LGFQESQJ6krn6SzM6), spent a few years in Connecticut at boarding school (Go Bearcats!), then came back to the West Coast for my undergraduate work in ***Industrial Engineering and Operations Research*** at the University of California, Berkeley, where I recently graduated (Go Bears! 🐻).

I usually like to work with data science, machine learning, optimization/mathematical-programming, or similar fields, however I am *agnostically curious* when it comes to computers, mathematics, and computer science and am happy to collaborate on projects across any of those disciplines. 

Reach out, it would be great to hear from you and maybe we could even develop some good personal, professional, or other synergies. 😊
